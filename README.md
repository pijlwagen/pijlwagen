# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hey there! I'm Michel, a passionate software developer and educator who loves both front-end and back-end developmentâ€”because why choose just one, when you can be the entire IT-department! Whether it's crafting sleek user interfaces or optimizing server logic, I enjoy working across the full stack to bring ideas to life.<br><br>Beyond web development, I have a huge fascination with embedded systems. If it has circuits, code, and especially blinking lights, I'm all in! From LED animations to interactive hardware projects, I love experimenting with technology that bridges the gap between software and the physical world.<br><br><br>Currently, Iâ€™m also teaching Software Development, helping the next generation of developers master the art of coding. Sharing knowledge, breaking down complex topics, and seeing students grow into skilled programmers is incredibly rewarding.<br><br>When Iâ€™m not coding or teaching, youâ€™ll probably find me tinkering with microcontrollers, exploring new frameworks, or building interactive tech projects. I also go outside, where I enjoy exploring industrial heritageâ€”old factories, power plants, historic machineryâ€”you name it.
